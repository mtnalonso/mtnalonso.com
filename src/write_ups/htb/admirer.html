                    <p>Doing a little bit of research about the application and its version (as it was shown in its login page), I found out that Adminer ver. 4.6.2 is presents a Local File Inclusion vulnerability.</p>
                    <p>This specific version of Adminer allows an attacker to connect to a database on its own machine from the Adminer application. However, as Adminer is running on the victim machine, it is possible to load the content of a file from the victim system.</p>
                    <p>This vulnerability and its exploit are further explained in <a href="https://www.foregenix.com/blog/serious-vulnerability-discovered-in-adminer-tool">this article</a> by Foregenix as well on <a href="https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/adminer-script-results-to-pwning-server-private-bug-bounty-program-fe6d8a43fe6f">this Medium post</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/YShahinzadeh?">@YShahinzadeh</a>.</p>
